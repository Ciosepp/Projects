Wire cutter

Cuts wires at specific legthes, usefull when a lot of cables has to be preciselly cutted.
Will be implemented an automatic length sequence calculator whenever all the wire legthes should follow a mathematical function.
Tha machine will also indent the wire guage so it can later be removed, exposing the metal.

Design is kept at minimun of features as it serves just as a tool for another project, where a lot of cables has to be prepared.
